# Netflix-LBO-Model
A one page leveraged buy out model to evaluate Netflix as an acquisition option for Disney.  This would be assuming Disney has the equity required.
  This model was completed using financial data from yahoo finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/financials?p=NFLX), and macro trends (https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NFLX/netflix/financial-statements).
The model assumes a 5 year holding period for predictive purposes and deals with a short income statement, cash flow statement, and debt structure to determine an ending IRR equity percentage.
The IRR equity percentage along with the sensitivity analysis, along with the cash-on-cash ratio show how little of a profitable investment this would be.
All in all the model is an example of a company that is not worth the risk.  Netflix's operating expenses are likely to raise as Disney will pull their movies from the network in the future to
bring headway to their new streaming platform.  This model serves as an experiment in company evaluation.  Disney already owns around thirty percent stake in Hulu, so reaching out to another streaming
platform is not all that unreasonable.  However, Netflix's margins are remarkably low for how successful the company has been in the past.
